				Firstly, thank you for the support and guidance you provided during my first year of studying mathematics. Your classes not only taught me a lot of math knowledge but also inspired my competitive spirit and desire to learn through the online competitions you held. Especially in one statistics competition on Dr. Frost, I remember I used a creative method to solve an integration problem that we had not learned at that point. This not only proved the value of self-study but also gave me great academic satisfaction. Thank you for creating such a positive learning environment and for giving us these opportunities.
