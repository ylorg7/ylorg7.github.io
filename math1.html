				Since the 11th grade, your careful guidance and attention have had a profound impact on me. I still remember the first time we met, when I solved a geometry problem in a creative way. Your encouragement made me more confident in my math studies, and your teaching helped me understand the true value and beauty of mathematics.

				You not only helped me achieve excellent grades in math but also inspired my love and curiosity for the subject. In the AS final exam, I scored full marks in the mechanics section, which was closely linked to your diligent teaching and encouragement. Your guidance has given me confidence and a sense of achievement in the world of mathematics.
