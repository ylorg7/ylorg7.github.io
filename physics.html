				Though my journey in learning physics was full of challenges, your teaching and strict requirements helped me make great progress in the subject. I achieved an A in the AS exam, which would not have been possible without your teaching and guidance. The resonance experiment competition you organised was a memorable experience where I simplified the steps and won the contest. This brought some joy to my physics studies.

				Despite our different choices in elective topics, I am grateful for the basic knowledge and guidance you provided. This allowed me to succeed in self-studying the engineering elective content. Your strict requirements and systematic teaching helped me significantly improve my physics grades in a short time.
